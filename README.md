# Skin-Cancer-Detection-With-CNN
This is my first project on Deep learning. In this project I have tried to build a deep-learning model to detect different types of skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The model was built with Keras and TensorFlow libraries.
