# Skin-Cancer-Detection-With-CNN
This is my first project on Deep learning. In this project I have tried to build a deep-learning model to detect different types of skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The model was built with Keras and TensorFlow libraries. I have used skin cancer images from HAM10000 dataset [Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C. & Kittler, H. "The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions" (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018161). The dataset seven different types of skin cancer:
- Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (AKIEC)
- Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
- Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)
- Dermatofibroma (DF)
- Melanoma (MEL)
- Melanocytic Nevi (NV) and
- Vascular Lesions (VASC).
