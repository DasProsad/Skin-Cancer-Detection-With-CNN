# Skin-Cancer-Detection-With-CNN
This is my first project on Deep learning. In this project I have tried to build a deep-learning model to detect different types of skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The model was built with Keras and TensorFlow libraries. I have used skin cancer images from HAM10000 dataset [Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C. & Kittler, H. (2018)](https://doi:10.1038/sdata.2018.161)
